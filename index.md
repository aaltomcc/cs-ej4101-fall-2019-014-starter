# About me

Hi there! And welcome to my tiny website created for _Introduction to DevOps_ course at Aalto University.

I'm working as a project manager at a translation services provider. Due to my... characteristics... I quickly was given technical translation projects to manage after I joined the company years ago. "Technical" meaning they include translating software files and also because I use a lot of client-specific tools in my work.

Currently, however, I'm on parental leave taking care of my 1.5-year-old girl. Slowly but surely the days were starting to take shape and the sleep was starting to be enough to be able to do something else with my time other than childcare, and then [Mimmit koodaa](https://mimmitkoodaa.ohjelmistoebusiness.fi/) entered my life. I learned about FiTech and this course at the fall 2019 Mimmit koodaa launch event.
