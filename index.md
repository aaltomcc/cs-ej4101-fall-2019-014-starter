## About me

Hi there! And welcome to my little website created for Introduction to DevOps course at Aalto University. 
I found the course through FiTech booth at Mimmit koodaa launch event. I stopped to talk to the nice people there and 
after mentioning I'm currently working as a project manager, I was recommended this course.

I'm working at a translation services provider as a project manager. Due to my... characteristics... I quickly was given 
technical translation projects to manage after I joined the company years ago. "Technical", meaning they include 
translating software files and also because I use a lot of client-specific tools in my work.

Currently, however, I'm on parental leave taking care of my 1.5-year-old girl. Slowly but surely the days were starting 
to take shape and the sleep was starting to be enough to be able to do something else with my time other than childcare
and then Mimmit koodaa entered my life.
