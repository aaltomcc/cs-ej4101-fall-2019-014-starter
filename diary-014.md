# Thoughts

## What lead me to this course?

After having worked in the translation industry for over a decade and after some industry-cultural changes that haven't sat well with me, I started to feel it would be nice to find my place in the (occupational) world. I've always dabbled with computers and it's a world I'm drawn to. For a long time I've agonized with trying to figure out what else a person with my background (and accumulated skills and knowledge) could do. Like for many women, I suppose, staying at home with a child -- very much detached from the everyday work life -- started a little ball rolling: what do I want to do when I "grow up"? Now I finally have some time (albeit late at night and with less than enough sleep) to really think about that!

This is where Mimmit koodaa steps in. First I participated in some interesting workshops (about React and Clojure) and then attended the autumn 2019 launch event. At FiTech booth I chatted with the nice people there and this course was recommended to me. FiTech course selection is overwhelming so I was glad to receive some advice to follow.

DevOps was a term I'd only heard before but didn't have any clue what it really meant -- so I basically expected to learn just that. I imagined it could be something IT project managers should know about (since I told the FiTech people I'm currently working as a PM). Little did I know it was bigger than that: it's a way of working, a (company) culture.

## What I learned?

In my translation projects I'd already experienced some Continuous Delivery in the localization step of a software project. Mostly, however, CD had been a synonym for unfinished source files and dummy text -- cryptic content to translate and frustration over having to spend time (and money) on content that will not be published. After taking this course, CD is not a curse word to me anymore because the whole approach to software development makes a lot of sense.

Automation is a very interesting topic as a whole, and I think I'll be looking more into it. I'm especially curious about the testing steps.

I'm an old-school HTML writer so all these markdowns and hugos aren't very palatable to me. For instance, Hugo claims to make building websites fun again, but for me it takes all the fun out of it! I suppose I'll end up looking more into it, too, because I'm curious to see how the advanced project should've been set up. Because of that, the most challenging part was probably using the GitHub pages' static site generator and a theme made by someone else. (I couldn't stop myself from tweaking the layout a little bit via CSS because I didn't like the way the page titles were showing at the top of the page, for example.)

I do have to admit that during this course I've been once more reminded that it may be time for me to evolve and find my web development fun from other things than the angle brackets. The industry demands it.
