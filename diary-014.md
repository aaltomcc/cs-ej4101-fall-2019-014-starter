# Thoughts

## What lead me to this course?

After having worked in the translation industry for over a decade and after some industry-cultural changes that haven't 
sat well with me, I started to feel it would be nice to find my place in the (occupational) world. I've always dabbled 
with computers and it's a world I'm drawn to. For a long time I've 
agonized with trying to figure out what else a person with my background (and accumulated skills and 
knowledge) could do. Like for many women, I suppose, staying at home with a child, very much detached from the 
everyday work life, started a little ball rolling: what do I want to do when I "grow up"? Now I would, in a way, 
finally have some time (albeit late at night and with less than enough sleep :sweat_smile: ) to really think about that!

This is where Mimmit koodaa steps in. First I participated in some interesting workshops (about React and Clojure) and 
then attended the autumn 2019 launch event. At FiTech booth I chatted with the nice people there and this course was 
recommended to me. FiTech course 
selection is overwhelming so I was glad to receive advice to follow.

DevOps was a term I'd only heard before but didn't have any clue what it really meant -- so I basically expected to 
learn just that. I imagined it could be something IT project managers should know about (since I told the FiTech people 
I'm currently working as a PM). Little did I know it was bigger than that: it's a way of working, a (company) culture.

## What I learned?

In my translation projects I'd already got to experience some Continuous Delivery in the localization step of a 
software project. Mostly CD had been a synonym for unfinished source files and dummy text - cryptic content to 
translate and frustration over having to spend time (and money) on content that will not be needed for the actual software. 
After taking this course, CD is not a curse word to me anymore because the whole approach to software 
development makes a lot of sense.

Automation is a very interesting topic as a whole, and I think I'll be looking more into it. I'm especially curious 
about the testing steps. 

I'm an old-school HTML writer so all these markdowns and hugos aren't very palatable to me. For instance, Hugo claims 
to make building websites fun again, but for me it takes all the fun out of it! On that note, the most challenging part 
was probably using the GitHub pages' static site generator and a theme made by someone else. 
I enjoy having better control over what things look like..! Now I was left wondering "why is this happening?!" but 
stopped myself from digging deeper -- for now -- because it's a little out of scope for this project.

I do have to admit that during this course I've been once more reminded that it may be time for me to evolve and find 
my web fun from other things than the angle brackets. The industry demands it.
