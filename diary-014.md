# Thoughts

## What lead me to this course?

After having worked in the translation industry for over a decade, I've started to feel it would be nice to find 
my place in the (occupational) world. I've always dabbled with computers and it's a world I'm drawn to. I've 
agonized with trying to figure out what else a person with my background (and hopefully accumulated skills and 
knowledge) could do.

This is where Mimmit koodaa steps in. First I participated in some interesting workshops (about React and Clojure) and then attended the autumn 
launch event. At FiTech booth I chatted with the people there and this course was recommended to me. FiTech course 
selection is overwhelming so I was glad to receive advice to follow.

DevOps was a term I'd only heard before but didn't have any clue what it really meant -- so I basically expected to 
learn just that. I imagined it could be something IT project managers should know about (since I told FiTech people 
I'm currently working as a PM). Little did I know it was bigger than that; it's a way of working, company culture.

## What I learned?

In my translation projects I'd already got to experience some Continuous Delivery in the localization step of a 
software project. Mostly CD had been a synonym for unfinished source files and dummy text - cryptic content to 
translate. After taking this course, CD is not a curse word to me anymore because the whole approach to software 
development makes a lot of sense.

Automation is a very interesting topic as a whole, and I think I'll be looking more into it. I'm especially curious 
about the testing step. 

The most challenging part was probably using the GitHub pages' static site generator and a theme made by someone else. 
I enjoy having better control over what things look like..! Now I was left wondering "why is this happening?!" but 
stopped myself from digging deeper -- for now -- because it's a little out of scope for this project.
