## What lead me to this course?

After having worked in the translation industry for over a decade, I've started to feel it would be nice to find 
my place in the (occupational) world. I've always dabbled with computers and it's a world I'm drawn to. I've 
agonized with trying to figure out what else a person with my background (and hopefully accumulated skills and 
knowledge) could do.

This is where Mimmit koodaa steps in. First I participated in some interesting workshops and then attended the autumn 
launch event. At FiTech booth I chatted with the people there and this course was recommended to me. The course 
selection is overwhelming so I was glad to have advice to follow.

DevOps was a term I'd only heard before but didn't have any clue what it really meant -- so I basically expected to 
learn just that. I imagined it could be something IT project managers should know about (since I told FiTech people 
I'm currently working as a PM). Little did I know it was bigger than that.
